The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game.
The sequence grows longer with each round, and the player must recall the entire sequence in the correct order to advance.
This project implements the Simon Game using jQuery, CSS, and HTML, providing a modern, interactive experience for users.
